        <h1>Michael Jordan</h1>
        <p>
          Jordan is the greatest scorer in the history of the game. He wasn't
          born with the power of Shaq or the size of Kareem, and yet he could
          not be stopped by any player on the court. He won the league's scoring
          title 10 times during his career, and this piled on the wins. Jordan
          won more than anyone. He set a record for wins in a season with the
          Bulls in 1996 when he led the team to 72 victories and a championship,
          a feat that wasn't broken for 20 years. He also has two separate
          threepeat championship runs, and a perfect 6–0 Finals record. Jordan
          was offensively godlike and was also a great defender. Jordan led the
          league in steals three times and was an all-defensive selection nine
          times! He also led the postseason in steals twice and led the
          postseason in scoring 10 times. Jordan was an unstoppable force
          throughout his time in the league, even with two separate retirements
          during his career. Michael Jordan was a visionary who took his
          dominant play on the court and created an empire with it. He's the
          greatest scorer the game has ever seen; his unblemished Finals record
          is something that many people claim make him the greatest. He
          completely owned the '90s, he created a shoe empire that made him a
          billionaire, and he made of the greatest kids movies of all time.
          Jordan is absolutely one of the greatest to ever do it.

        <h1>LeBron James</h1>
        <p>
          LeBron James is the greatest player of all time. He has dominated the
          NBA since he came into the league at the young age of 18, fresh out of
          high school. When James came into the league, he was looked at as "The
          Chosen One" who would take the mantle of greatest from Jordan, and he
          did. LeBron has done things that no other player before him has been
          able to do. He carried a decrepit 2007 Cleveland Cavaliers team to the
          Finals all on his own. He's defeated not one but two of the league's
          greatest dynasties for championships in the San Antonio Spurs and
          Golden State Warriors. He also brought a championship to Cleveland
          after a 52-year championship drought. Not only has James accomplished
          great things, but he also plays at a higher level and a more
          well-rounded level than anyone in history. James can do it all. He can
          score on any given night, he can rebound the ball, and he is the
          greatest passing forward in league history. He currently is the only
          player in league history that sits in the top 10 for points scored and
          assists. He also sits in the top 50 all-time in rebounds. He's the
          only player ever to record over 34,000 points. 9,000 assists, and
          9,000 rebounds. James recently finished playing in his 17th season,
          and yet he still is arguably the best player in the league and is
          unarguably a top-five player. He has dominated in his youth, his
          prime, and now in his later years. When the game is on the line, even
          if he doesn't win, he is going to be the best player on the court.

        <h1>Bill Russell</h1>
        <p>
          Bill Russell was the ultimate winner in the history of the NBA. He won
          a league title in all but two of his 13 seasons as a member of the
          Boston Celtics. Yes, the NBA consisted of just 8 to 14 teams during
          this period, so capturing championships was a statistically easier
          feat for a single franchise, but even that fact doesn’t minimize
          Russell’s historic accomplishments. The Celtics had played for 10
          seasons before Russell joined the team, never once reaching a
          championship series in that time. But in his rookie year, Russell
          completely changed the franchise’s course and established the Celtics
          as the winningest team in the NBA. But he didn’t earn his place on
          this list though some sort of vague, ethereal “winningness.” Russell
          was one of the fiercest defenders of all time and he redefined the
          value of blocking shots, in addition to averaging an incredible 22.5
          rebounds per game over his career.

        <h1>Tim Duncan</h1>
        <p>
          I have a confession to make: even though I’m a lifelong devotee to all
          Seattle sports team, I had a fan-fling with the San Antonio Spurs
          teams of the late ‘90s and early 2000s. Yes, they played the kind of
          slow-paced ball that put most fans to sleep by the third quarter, but
          there was often a thing of pure beauty hidden among the tire-fire of a
          78–71 final score: Tim Duncan’s bank shot. In his prime, Duncan,
          nicknamed “The Big Fundamental” by no less a nickname authority than
          Shaquille O’Neal, was one of the most sound players of all time. While
          his famously vanilla playing style and quiet demeanor kept him from
          having a cultural impact similar to the other greats, his four
          championships, 14 All-Star Games, and two NBA MVP awards are
          indisputable evidence of his fantastic ability.

        <h1>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</h1>
        <p>
          What? The leading scorer in National Basketball Association (NBA)
          history is just the 10th-best player ever? Indeedy. While Kareem put
          up a whopping 38,387 points during his playing days, I can’t look past
          the fact that he spent a good chunk of his career receiving passes
          from Oscar Robertson and Magic Johnson, the two greatest point guards
          of all time. Also, his career totals were inflated by the fact that he
          played roughly 10,000 years in the NBA. (Or 20. Whatever.)
          Nevertheless, he was an awesome force who dominated the sport for two
          decades and perfected the sky hook, one of the most gorgeous shots the
          game has ever seen. Plus, he was hilarious in Airplane! and fought
          Bruce Lee in Game of Death, so his cool quotient is easily the highest
          of anyone on this list.
