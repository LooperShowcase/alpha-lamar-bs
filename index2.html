        <td>
          Australia produces some great athletes, and I think that if the AFL
          wasn’t around, more Australians would be spread around the globe as
          professionals in a variety of sports. The ABA league was a fast and
          physical game that had me in fantastic physical condition. Sydney
          afforded me the opportunity to frequently play against a variety of
          competition and the access to the game here is fantastic. Many indoor
          courts offer availability to shoot or get involved in open runs, and
          the city, with its cosmopolitan setup, offered competition against a
          range of players and skill levels from around the world.

        <td>
          Filipinos love basketball. In a country with over 7000 islands and
          hundreds of dialects, basketball has become a uniting force. Sadly,
          the main pro-league only operates around Manila, but that doesn’t seem
          to have fazed many – I’ve seen basketball courts in some of the most
          remote locations you can imagine, with children running around
          barefoot throwing up shots. I managed to coach at a local school in
          the city of Davao, where the current President Duterte was originally
          mayor. What the kids there lacked in proper equipment and skill
          development, they more than made up for in passion for the game. The
          NBA is readily available on TV, which would explain why so many local
          players mimic American stars. To a point, of course. As a generally
          shorter nation of people, Filipinos’ games tend to be more below the
          rim, featuring flashy moves and dribbling displays.

        <td>Vietnam</td>
        <td>
          Basketball is not a big game in Vietnam – football, tennis and
          ping-pong tend to rule the roost there. Unlike the Philippines, you
          won’t see makeshift hoops and courts all over the cities. I had to
          travel down to a large expat community on the outskirts of Ho-Chi Minh
          city to get an opportunity to play. Some of the local pro-players
          would turn up to our open sessions, so it was a good opportunity to
          test my skills against these players. Like many countries in Southeast
          Asia, the pro-level is made up of a mixture of import, naturalised
          citizens and homegrown players. The game remains mainly below the rim
          and is less physical than the higher levels in Australia. One of the
          highlights was watching Lou jump across two guys to grab a rebound and
          make a put back – it’s always fun to see guys’ reactions when that
          happens.

        <td>England</td>
        <td>
          Sadly, England cut the majority of funding to basketball after the
          2012 Olympics, so development of the game will continue at a snail’s
          pace. Basketball has always appeared to have a somewhat underground
          culture in the UK and the pro league follows similar rules regarding
          import players to many of the leagues around the world (a maximum of
          two per team). The game itself is not as physical as it is in the US
          and Australia, focusing more on skill development. But without a
          thriving network of its own, talented players are usually encouraged
          to leave at the earliest opportunity, either for high school
          opportunities in the States or academies in Europe.
        </td>

      <tr>
        <td>Hong Kong</td>
        <td>
          Hong Kong is obsessed with basketball sneaker culture like nowhere
          else I’ve been. Every corner has a Nike store and you can’t go a few
          streets without running into a sign for a collector's shoe store.
          Passion for for the sport is also evident on the streets, with many
          outdoor courts dotted around the city. During the evenings,
          floodlights go on and people play. The love for street ball is
          represented in players’ flashy dribble sequences and elaborate moves.
          To an old-timer like me, that kind of showmanship defeats the purpose
          of actually scoring the basketball efficiently, but the energy of the
          city is unique. And being able to shoot baskets on a court nestled in
          among the vast high-rises was an experience I’ll never forget.
