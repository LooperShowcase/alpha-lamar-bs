      basketball, game played between two teams of five players each on a
      rectangular court, usually indoors.
      <br />
      Each team tries to score by tossing the ball through the opponentâ€™s goal,
      an elevated horizontal hoop and net called a basket.
      <br />
      history:
      <br />
      In the early years the number of players on a team varied according to the
      number in the class and the size of the playing area.
      <br />
      In 1894 teams began to play with five on a side when the playing area was
      less than 1,800 square feet (167.2 square metres); the number rose to
      seven when the gymnasium measured from 1,800 to 3,600 square feet (334.5
      square metres) and up to nine when the playing area exceeded that.
      <br />
      In 1895 the number was occasionally set at five by mutual consent; the
      rules stipulated five players two years later, and this number has
      remained ever since.
